[Installation note of snappy-jave]

-section: Requirements
Necessary libraries for building snappy-java:

[For all platforms]

* Java 6 (JDK1.6) http://java.sun.com/
 - set JAVA_HOME environment variable to the Java installation folder (e.g. C:/Program Files/Java/jdk1.6.0_24 in Windows)
* Maven 3.x http://maven.apache.org/
 - mvn command 

[Windows (32/64bit)]
* GNU make 
* tar, curl, cp, rm commands (I use Cygwin for building snappy-java in Windows)


[Windows (64-bit)]
* Download MinGW-w64 http://sourceforge.net/projects/mingw-w64/ 
* Set PATH to the following commands in the downloaded archive: 
 - x86_64-w64-mingw32-g++
 - x86_64-w64-mingw32-strip

(Do not use the Cygwin version of MinGW-w64, because it fails to build assemblies for 64bit environment)
 
[Windows (32-bit)]
* Install MinGW http://www.mingw.org/
* Set PATH to the following command in MinGW package
 - mingw32-g++
 - strip
